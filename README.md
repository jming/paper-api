# Printing Paper Technology for Development
by Joy Ming, Ishita Ghosh, Jay Chen, and Azza Abouzied

Despite the recent push toward leveraging information communication technologies (ICTs)
for replacing paper-based tasks, there remain many barriers to designing deployable
and appropriate technical solutions that replace paper. As a result, paper tools
such as forms, charts, and graphs continue to be widely used in low-resource 
organizations working in developing regions. However, designing effective paper-based tools 
that perform computation-like tasks such as addition, subtraction, lookup, and visualization 
can be difficult. In this demo, we present printr, a system that allows a publisher to rapidly 
generate and print these “smart” paper tools. With printr we demonstrate one way to improve paper 
tools and leverage benefits of both paper and ICTs with only a fraction of the development, deployment, 
training, and operational costs of software applications.
